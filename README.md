# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning
and anomaly detection techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data,
special care is taken in model evaluation and feature preprocessing.

## 📊 Dataset
Credit Card Transactions Dataset  
(Target variable: `Class` → 0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

> Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)

## ⚠️ Key Challenges
- Highly imbalanced dataset
- False negatives in fraud detection
- Feature scaling and preprocessing

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## 🚀 Results
The balanced Logistic Regression model achieved improved fraud recall while maintaining
reasonable precision.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- SMOTE for better imbalance handling
- Deep learning models
- Real-time fraud detection pipeline
